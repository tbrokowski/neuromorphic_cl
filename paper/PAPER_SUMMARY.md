## 🔬 Mathematical Rigor

### Concept Encoder
```latex
\mathbf{c} = \frac{\mathbf{c}_v + \mathbf{c}_t}{2}, \quad 
\mathcal{L}_{\text{align}} = -\log \frac{\exp(\mathbf{c}_v^T \mathbf{c}_t / \tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^N \exp(\mathbf{c}_v^T \mathbf{c}_{t,j} / \tau)}
```

### Prototype Manager
```latex
\mathbf{p}_{i^*} \leftarrow \alpha \mathbf{p}_{i^*} + (1 - \alpha) \mathbf{c}
```

### SNN Dynamics
```latex
\tau_m \frac{du_i(t)}{dt} = -u_i(t) + \sum_j w_{ji} s_j(t) + I_i^{\text{ext}}(t)
```

### STDP Learning
```latex
\Delta w_{ji} = \begin{cases}
A_+ \exp(-\Delta t / \tau_+) & \text{if } \Delta t > 0 \\
-A_- \exp(\Delta t / \tau_-) & \text{if } \Delta t < 0
\end{cases}
```
